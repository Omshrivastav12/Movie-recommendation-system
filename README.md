# Movie-recommendation-system
This project develops a movie suggestion model using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to offer personalized movie recommendations based on user-provided keywords. The model leverages NLP techniques such as word embeddings to analyze user preferences and historical interactions. Additionally, content-based filtering is employed to enhance recommendation accuracy by considering the content of the movies. By combining these approaches, the model enhances user experience by providing tailored movie suggestions aligned with individual tastes and preferences.
